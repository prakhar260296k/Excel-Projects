                                                  Customer Order Analysis

We have 2 sheets in the excel file. 1st sheet has details of the customer making the orders whereas the 2nd sheet tells us about the sales transactions  made by the customers during a certain time period.

Steps involved in the project :
1.	Data cleaning plus Data Preparation : We need to eliminate inconsistencies in data. Eg. Dates were present in a format which was not uniform across the sheet. Objective is to clean up the data, get customer wise sales transactions
2.	Reporting in Excel : Use of macros to automate few steps within the Excel file. With the selection of a customer using dropdown, we get all details of the customer shown plus the orders placed by him/her during a specific time period. 
Created a graph to show Order amount placed by Customers on a monthly quarterly and yearly basis.
