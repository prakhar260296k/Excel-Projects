																									#Customer Order Analysis 

Here we have 2 sheets in the excel file. 1st sheet has details of the customer who is making the orders whereas the 2nd sheet tells us about the orders made by the customers during some date range. 

Post this, steps involved in this specific project :
1.	Data cleaning plus Data Preparation : We need to improve inconsistencies in data. Eg. Names of customers need to have proper casing to avoid confusion. Objective is to clean up the data to get insights out of it. 
2.	Reporting in Excel : Create report using the data in a new sheet to get insights out of the tabulated data already present in the other sheets of the excel file. 
Use of macros to automate few steps within the Excel file. With the selection of a customer using dropdown, we get all details of the customer shown plus the orders placed by him/her during a specific time period. 
Created a graph to show Order amount placed by Customers on a yearly basis plus on a monthly basis.
